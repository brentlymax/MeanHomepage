 MEAN stack structure for my homepage.

MongoDB </br>
Express </br>
Angular </br>
Node </br>

This is mostly up for people to look at if they are interested in creating their own MEAN stack Website. </br>
I'm working on a guide I've written myself for setting this up and will include it in future commit. </br>
General Linux proficiency is helpful, but even an inexperienced user could follow my guide. </br>

It runs through the following: </br>
Setting up an EC2 Amazon Linux 2 instance </br>
Linking your domain name to said instance with a reverse proxy </br>
Setting up TLS security </br>
Running your server as a daemon process </br>
Installing the four components of MEAN </br>
